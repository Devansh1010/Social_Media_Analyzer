# Social Media Analyzer

## Overview  
**Social Media Analyzer** is a specialized tool designed to analyze social media engagement data and generate insightful, user-friendly reports. It takes user instructions, fetches data directly from a connected database, and delivers tailored analytics focused on likes, shares, and comments across different post types (e.g., carousels, reels, static images).  

This tool is **strictly limited** to its intended functionality of engagement analysis and reporting. It does not handle or respond to queries outside its scope.
